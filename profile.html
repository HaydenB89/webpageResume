    <h3>How I came to MAX Technical Training</h3>
    <p>
        I chose to enroll in a coding bootcamp for a major career change. I have always been interesed in technology develpment, whether it is web based or programing.
        I fell into MAX Technical Traing by recommendation through my apprenticeship, Apprenti. The direction Apprenti drove me in is now clear as to why MAX was an excelent choice.

    <h3>My time in the bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
        Before the start of the bootcamp, many of the staff and graduates will tell you, "IT IS TOUGH!" This is no exaggeration. We hit the ground running with navigating GitBash,
        and linking projects to GitHub, for cloud-based storage and sharing. Then, we jump into C# (not just the basics). C# is covered in great detail, but it is a wise setup
        because learning this language set up a good base for the programming disciplines following the curriculum. After C# we learn to set up web hosting and dabble in some basic 
        HTML code, followed by JavaScript and Angular. Is it "tough?" Very much so! However, this style of learning code helps your mind stay with the work AND you can connect the 
        practices from weeks before, without having to skim through notes from semesters or years before like in college.

    <h3>What lies ahead</h3>
    <p>
        Though I am in and apprenticeship, and I know what my next course of action is, MAX bundles in resume building and interview training with the program. With this type of aid, 
        newbie progamers, as myself, are nearly garunteed to find a fitting career post graduating the bootcamp. Another plus-side of MAX is they have established themselves as a reliable 
        source of entry level programers with a toolbag of basic skills to be competent and confident in the tech industry. There is also a slew of helpful grad students willing to 
        keep in touch with new hires from the bootcamp, keeping us up to date on budding technologies.
